/*

To Do list:
  -Add basic GUI

*/

/*

Design:

For the first version ( v1.0 ) of the GUI, I am thinking of a BorderLayout style with different areas seperated by borders.
The first version shall have 1 non-editable text field that will display the kind of input allowed. In addition, the first
version should also include an exit button, start and stop buttons, and an "LED" that will be green if the session/communication
is working and red if the session/communication with the robot is not working.

ALL OTHER FEATURES SHOULD BE ADDED TO LATER VERSIONS
